# Introduction
- compares local density of the outliers to the local density of its K neighbours
- if a points local density is significantly lower than its K nearest neighbours, it can be called as an anomaly
- this density is calculated by the inverse of the reachability distance


## Selection criteria
- used when the anomaly is very close to the actual points but less densely packed
- will flag high density and sparse clusters as normal, but a loose point near a dense cluster as an anomaly
- asd
- asd

## How it works?
